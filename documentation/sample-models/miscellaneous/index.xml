      <description>Accessing simulation results - example This is an extended example for the further treatment of simulation results: accessing the results, plotting, cropping, slicing and exporting. This serves as a supporting example to the Accessing simulation results  tutorial.
 The standard &amp;ldquo;Cylinders in DWBA&amp;rdquo; sample (see this example) is used for running the simulation. The simulation results are retrieved as a Histogram2D object and then processed in various functions to achieve a resulting image.</description>

      <description>Plotting with axes in different units In this example we demonstrate how to plot intensity data with detector axes expressed in different units. It serves as a supporting example to the Accessing simulation results  tutorial.
 The standard &amp;ldquo;Cylinders in DWBA&amp;rdquo; sample (see this example) is used to setup the simulation. When the simulation is completed, the Simulation::getIntensityData() method is used to get a Histogram2D object. Depending on an additional parameter IDetector2D.</description>
