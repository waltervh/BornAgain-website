      <description>Interference 1D Lattice Scattering from long boxes distributed along a one-dimensional lattice.
 The particles are long boxes. Each box has a length of $1000$ nm, a width of $10$ nm and a height of $15$ nm. The particles are placed along a one-dimensional lattice on top of a substrate. They are rotated in the $(x,y)$ plane by $10^{\circ}$ with respect the the $x$-axis of the reference cartesian frame. The 1D lattice is characterized by a lattice length of $30$ nm.</description>

      <description>Interference 2D Square Lattice Scattering from cylindrical particles distributed along a square lattice.
 Cylinders with radii and heights of $3$ nm are deposited on a substrate. Because of the presence of the substrate layer the simulation is run using the DWBA. The particles are distributed along a square lattice with a lattice length of $25$ nm. The main axes are parallel to the $x$-axis and $y$-axis of the reference Cartesian frame, respectively.</description>

      <description>Interference 2D Centered Square Lattice Scattering from cylinders distributed along a squared centered lattice.
 The particles are cylinders with radii and heights of $3$ nm. Their spatial distribution is composed of two square lattices (lattice length $l$), shifted by half a lattice length in both directions: The first square lattice is centered at the origin, with a lattice length of $25$ nm. The second one, with the same lattice spacing and the same type of particles at its nodes is initialized at $x = y = l/2 = 12.</description>

      <description>Rectangular grating In this example we simulate the scattering from infinite 1D repetition of rectangular patches (rectangular grating). This is done by using the interference function of a 1D lattice together with very long boxes. While being similar to the Interference 1D lattice example, this example explains the lattice orientation in more details.
 By-default, the axis of the one-dimensional lattice coincides with the $x$-axis of the reference cartesian frame, so it coinsides with the beam direction.</description>
