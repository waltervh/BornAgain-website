#### BornAgain 1.4 has been released
{{% /alert %}}

This release provides an easier way to use `IntensityData` objects from Python and added new export formats for simulation data. Accompanied by a big refactoring, the new version also provides for better integration of new detector geometries. As a first application of this, a rectangular detector geometry has been defined in the core library.

**Summary of changes in the code:**

1. Improved usability of IntensityData objects (slicing, histogram filling, ...)
1. GUI: export of simulation results into tiff or ascii file
1. Core: rectangular detector added (not yet in GUI)
1. Core: simulation and fit with masks applied to the detector plane
1. Core: genetic algorithm implemented, no need to install ROOT framework anymore
1. Automatic normalization of detector pixel intensity when beam intensity > 0
1. Various bugfixes

**New examples:**

1. [Fitting with masks]({{< relref "documentation/sample-models/fitting-new/advanced/fit-with-masks/index.md" >}})
1. [Fitting along slices]({{< relref "documentation/sample-models/fitting-new/advanced/fit-along-slices/index.md" >}})
1. [Fitting two datasets]({{< relref "documentation/sample-models/fitting-new/advanced/multiple-datasets/index.md" >}})

**API changes:**
1. `Simulation::getIntensityData()::getArray()` returns a numpy array with numpy-standard row, column layout (no rotation is required anymore)
1. `FitSuite::addFitParameter(name, start_value, limits, step)` order of fit parameters changed
