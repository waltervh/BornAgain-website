Most of the efforts in this sprint have been devoted to porting more features from the core library to the GUI.

**Summary of changes in the code:**

1.  New form factor: truncated cube
1.  New features in Graphical User Interface:
    *   Beam divergence, detector resolution function
    *   `ParticleComposition` (particles composed from other particles)
    *   `ParticleDistribution` (particles with size distribution)
    *   Export of GUI simulation into a Python script

**API changes:**

1. `LatticeBasis` now is called a `ParticleComposition`
1. `Transform3D` object is removed in the favor of `RotationX`, `RotationY`, `RotationZ` and `RotationEuler` objects
