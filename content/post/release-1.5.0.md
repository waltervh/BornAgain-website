#### BornAgain 1.5 has been released
{{% /alert %}}

During this release we have worked on preparing the implementation of fitting in the GUI, and even if the fitting is not there yet, we are getting close.

**Summary of changes in the code:**

1. Core: interference function calculates particle densities automatically, when possible.
1. GUI: 1D interference function is now available.
1. GUI: new rectangular detector providing more accurate simulation of real life setup.
1. GUI: new mask editor allows to draw various shapes on top of intensity map to exclude it from the analysis.
1. GUI: Selection of axes (degrees, radians,number of bins, Q-space) for intensity data.
1. Note for Linux users: we have migrated to C++11 (minimal compiler version changed).
1. Note for Linux users: new dependency from Eigen library.
1. Compatibility issues: back compatibility with GUI's old project files is broken.
1. Various bugfixes.

**New tutorials:**

1. [How to setup PyCharm project](#)
1. [Detector types tutorial]({{< relref "documentation/working-with-python/detector-types" >}})
1. [Accessing simulation results tutorial]({{< relref "documentation/working-with-python/accessing-simulation-results/index.md" >}})
1. [Importing experimental data]({{< relref "documentation/working-with-python/fitting/fitting-highlights/instrument-description" >}})

1. [Plotting with axes in different units]({{< relref "documentation/sample-models/miscellaneous/axes-in-different-units/index.md" >}})

**API changes:**

1. `FTDecayFunctions` introduced to use together with 1D and 2D lattices instead of former `FTDistributionFunctions`.
1. Use `InterferenceFunction1DLattice::setDecayFunction()` instead of former `InterferenceFunction1DLattice::setProbabilityDistribution()`
