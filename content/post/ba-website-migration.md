#### Website and mailing list migration
{{% /alert %}}

Dear BornAgain users,

We are migrating our BornAgain documentation to a new website. Our current `Drupal` based version, as you know it, will go to the other world. But no need for sadness - the new version will be better and will be available under the same address [www.bornagainproject.org](www.bornagainproject.org). The side effect of this migration is that we have to discontinue our current mailing list. To be able to receive notifications about new releases, please register at https://lists.fz-juelich.de/mailman/listinfo/BornAgain-announcements.

Sincerely yours,

The BornAgain team.
