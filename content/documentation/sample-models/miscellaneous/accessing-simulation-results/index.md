### Accessing simulation results - example

This is an extended example for the further treatment of simulation results: accessing the results, plotting, cropping, slicing and exporting. This serves as a supporting example to the [Accessing simulation results
]({{% ref-tutorial "accessing-simulation-results/index.md" %}}) tutorial.

* The standard "Cylinders in DWBA" sample (see [this example]({{%ref-example "embedded-particles/cylinders-dwba" %}})) is used for running the simulation.
* The simulation results are retrieved as a `Histogram2D` object and then processed in various functions to achieve a resulting image.
