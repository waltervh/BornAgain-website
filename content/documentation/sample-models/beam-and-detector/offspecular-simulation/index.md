### Off-Specular

Off-specular scattering from a monodisperse distribution of long boxes.

* The sample is made of very long boxes with length equal to $1000$ nm, width $20$ nm and height $10$ nm.
* The particles are distributed along a one-dimensional lattice with a lattice spacing of $100$ nm in the $x$-direction.
* The particles are rotated around the $z$-axis by $90^{\circ}$ so that their "infinite" dimension is parallel to the $y$-direction.
* The incident wavelength is equal to $1$ $\unicode{x212B}$.
* The output intensity is the result of an average over $\phi\_i$ comprised between $-1^{\circ}$ and $1^{\circ}$ and of a scan of $\alpha\_i$ and $\alpha\_f$ between $0^{\circ}$ and $10^{\circ}$.

> #### Note:  
> The two-dimensional output intensity is plotted as a function of $\alpha\_i$ and $\alpha\_f$.
