### Fitting reflectometry data

In this example we will fit reflectometry data obtained from `GenX` for the sample
previously used in
[reflectometry simulation tutorial]({{% ref-tutorial "basic-simulation-tutorial/reflectometry" %}}).

The only fitting parameter of the simulation considered here is the thickness of the Ti
layers. The reference data was obtained under the following assumptions:

* All Ti layers have the same thickness
* Thickness value was $3 \, nm$

The fit view produced by running the fitting script is shown in the picture.
The right-hand part of the view contains information about the current iteration
of the fitting process, the maximum relative difference $d_{r, max}$ between the
reference and the simulated data, and the current values of the fitting parameters.

One should note that in the current example the `BornAgain` built-in fitting engine and
default minimizer (namely, `Minuit`) was used to fit the data.

The minimizer can be selected by the `setMinimizer` command:

```python
minimizer = ba.Minimizer()
minimizer.setMinimizer("Genetic", "", "MaxIterations=30")
```

This code snippet replaces the default `Minuit` minimizer with the `Genetic` one, which is
recommended to use for complicated multi-dimensional fitting tasks.

### Further topics

A much more sophisticated example of fitting experimental reflectometry data with
`BornAgain` and an external minimizer can be
found in `Examples/python/fitting/ex03_ExtendedExamples/specular/RealLifeReflectometryFitting.py`
in the BornAgain directory.
