### Interference 2D Paracrystal

Scattering from monodisperse cylinders distributed along a two-dimensional square paracrystal.

* The particles are cylinders with constant radii and heights equal to $5$ nm.
* They are deposited on a substrate, following a two-dimensional square paracrystalline pattern.
* This 2D paracrystal is characterized by:
    * a lattice length of $20$ nm along both axes of the reference Cartesian frame,
    * a damping length equal to $0$,
    * "coherent' domains with a size of $20$ $\mu$m along the axes of the reference Cartesian frame.
* The incident beam is characterized by a wavelength of $1$ $\unicode{x212B}$ and angles $\alpha\_i = 0.2 ^{\circ}$ and $\phi\_i = 0^{\circ}$.  


> #### Note:
> A damping length is used to introduce finite size effects by applying a multiplicative coefficient equal to $exp \left(-\frac{peak\\_distance}{damping\\_length}\right)$ to the Fourier transform of the probability densities. $damping\\_length$ is equal to $0$ by default and, in this case, no correction is applied.
