## VSCode editor

In this tutorial we explain how to run BornAgain Python examples in a convenient manner using the `VSCode` editor.
This is a community driven, lightweighted and open-source editor from Microsoft, which provides code highlighting for many languages and
can be extremely handy in any kind of script-related and code-related activity.

At this point we assume that the user has already installed BornAgain and a Python distribution as explained in
[Python installation section]({{% relref "documentation/getting-started/installation/windows/python-original" %}}).

### Download and install VSCode

Download the editor from [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com).

### Add the BornAgain examples to VSCode

Start `VSCode` and you will find yourself on the welcome screen.

Add the folder with the BornAgain Python examples to the workspace
by clicking `Add workspace folder` as shown in the screenshot below.

Choose the directory with the BornAgain Python examples at `C:/BornAgain-{{< release-string >}}/Examples/python`.
If you open any example, `VSCode` will require you to configure the Python interpreter to use. In the screenshot below, `VSCode` is complaining 
that no Python interpreter was selected and also suggests to install the so-called `pylint` plugin for a better code development experience.

Click on `Select Python Interpreter` and select the interpreter you have installed previously. Install `pylint` too.
On the screenshot below `VSCode` is fully configured and ready for work.

Finally you can run an example using the right mouse button.

The script will be executed in a terminal embedded in `VSCode` and a scattering image will appear on the screen after simulation has completed.

Now you can try to run other BornAgain Python examples and start your exciting journey in Python scripting with BornAgain!
