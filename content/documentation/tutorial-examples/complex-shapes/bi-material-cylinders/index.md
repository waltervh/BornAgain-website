### Cylinders with Two Materials

In this example it is modelled a multi layer consisting of a substrate layer and an air layer. 
Cylindrical particles made of two materials are added to the air layer and their $z$ coordinate is shifted downwards in order to cross the air-substrate interface.

Scattering from cuboidal core-shell particles.
