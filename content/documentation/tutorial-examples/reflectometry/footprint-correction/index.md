### Specular simulation with a footprint correction

This example demonstrates taking into account the beam footprint correction
in specular simulations.

Footprint effect originates from non-infinite sizes of beam and sample. Then at
small incident angles $\alpha_i$ the beam irradiates an area bigger than the
area of the sample. Exact footprint impact depends on the ratio between the widths of beam and sample
as well as on the shape of the beam.

When taking into account footprint correction, there are two possible options for the
beam shape in `BornAgain`:

* Square beam --- the beam has sharp edges and square cross-section,
                  its intensity is uniformly distributed.
* Gaussian beam --- the beam is infinite in space, while its intensity has Gaussian
                    distribution along the radius of the beam.

The footprint correction for square beam is defined by
`FootprintFactorSquare` command, which has the signature

```python
<footprint_object> = FootprintFactorSquare(beam_to_sample_width_ratio)
```

Here `<footprint_object>` is an object later passed to the simulation, while `beam_to_sample_width_ratio`
defines the ratio between the widths of beam and sample.

In the case of the Gaussian beam the footprint object is created with

```python
<footprint_object> = FootprintFactorGaussian(beam_to_sample_width_ratio)
```

The command signature is exactly the same as in the case with the square beam,
but the beam width required for `beam_to_sample_width_ratio`
is now defined as the beam diameter associated with the intensity level equal to $I_0 \cdot e^{-\frac{1}{2}}$,
where $I_0$ is the on-axis (maximal) intensity.

In this example a square beam is considered, with `beam_to_sample_width_ratio` being equal to $0.01$.
The incident angle range was made rather small in this example
(from $0.0$ to $0.6$ degrees) in order to emphasize
the footprint impact at small incident angles.
In other respects this example exactly matches the
[reflectometry simulation tutorial]({{% ref-tutorial "basic-simulation-tutorial/reflectometry" %}}).
