### Beam Angualr Spread in Specular Simulations

This example demonstrates beam angular spread effects in reflectivity computations.
It also offers a comparison with data generated using another well known code: GenX.
Further information about reflectometry simulations can be found in the
[Reflectometry Simulation Tutorial]({{% ref-tutorial "basic-simulation-tutorial/reflectometry" %}}).

The observed reflectometry signal can be affected either by a spread in the beam wavelength or in the incident angle.

In this example, a Gaussian distribution is used to spread the incident angle, with a standard deviation of $\sigma_{\alpha} = 0.01^{\circ}$.
