### Beam divergence

By default, the incident beam is perfectly monochromatic and collimated.
Here we show how to set finite distributions of wavelengths and of incident angles.

* The wavelength follows a log-normal distribution around the mean value of $1$ $\unicode{x212B}$ with a scale parameter equal to $0.1$.
* Both incident angles follow a Gaussian distribution around the average values $\alpha\_i = 0.2 ^{\circ}$ and $\phi\_i = 0^{\circ}$, respectively and $\sigma_{\alpha\_i} = \sigma\_{\phi\_i} = 0.1^{\circ}$.

The DWBA simulation is shown for a standard sample model:

* The sample is composed of monodisperse cylinders deposited on a substrate.
* The cylinders are dilute and distributed at random,
  hence there is no interference between scattered waves.
