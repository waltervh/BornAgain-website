## Cylinders in Averaged Layer

Supposing a `Simulation` has been defined in which some layers contain embedded particles of different materials; to regard those layers as composed by a single material, the `setUseAvgMaterials` method is used:

```
simulation.getOptions().setUseAvgMaterials(True)
```

The script below shows how to average materials when simulating scattering from a square lattice of cylinders inside a finite layer.
