### Interference - Superposition of Square Lattices

This example demonstrates how to perform a simulation of scattering from cylinders distributed in a square lattice fashion. The resultant 2D lattice is a sum of rotated lattices with different disorder.

This example is similar to [Interference of a rotated square lattice]({{% ref-example "interference-functions/interference-2d-rotated-square-lattice" %}}).
