### Spheres on Hexagonal Lattice

Scattering from spheres distributed along a hexagonal lattice.

* The sample is made of spherical particles with radii of $10$ nm deposited on a substrate along a hexagonal lattice.
* This two-dimensional lattice is characterized by a lattice length of $20$ nm. Its a-axis coincides with the x-axis of the reference Cartesian frame.
* The wavelength is equal to $1$ $\unicode{x212B}$.
* The incident angles are $\alpha\_i = 0.2 ^{\circ}$ and $\phi\_i = 0^{\circ}$.
