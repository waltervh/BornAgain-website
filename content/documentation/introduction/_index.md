## Introduction

BornAgain is a software package to simulate and fit small-angle scattering at grazing incidence. It supports analysis of both X-ray (GISAXS) and neutron (GISANS) data.  Its name, BornAgain, indicates the central role of the distorted wave Born approximation  in the physical description of the scattering process.  The software provides a generic framework for modeling multilayer samples with smooth or rough interfaces and with various types of embedded nanoparticles.

BornAgain almost completely reproduces the functionality of the widely used program IsGISAXS by R. Lazzari [J. Appl. Cryst. 35, 406–421 (2002)]. BornAgain goes beyond IsGISAXS by supporting an unrestricted number of layers and particles, the diffuse reflection from rough layer interfaces, particles with inner structures, neutron polarization and magnetic scattering. Adhering to a strict object-oriented design, BornAgain provides a solid base for future extensions in response to specific user needs.

BornAgain is a multi-platform software, with active support for Linux, MacOS and Microsoft Windows. It is free and open source, available under the GNU General Public License (GPL v3 or higher).

This online documentation is complementary to the User Manual, which contains background information on the theoretical models implemented in the software.

**Disclaimer**

Software and documentation are work in progress. We cannot guarantee that they are accurate and correct. Anyway, it is entirely in the responsibility of users to ensure that their data interpretation is physically meaningful. If in doubt, please contact us. We are grateful for all kind of feedback: criticism, praise, bug reports, feature  requests or contributed modules. If questions go beyond normal user support, we will be glad to discuss a scientific collaboration.
