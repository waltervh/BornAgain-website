## Fitting

Fitting in BornAgain is used to find the values of sample or instrument
parameters that best represent the data obtained in the user's
scattering experiment.

In this section we will give a brief overview of the concept and describe how to setup and perform fits in BornAgain using the Python API.
For a brief overview about fitting using the graphical user interface 
please see [here]({{% relref "documentation/running-gui/gui-fitting" %}}).
