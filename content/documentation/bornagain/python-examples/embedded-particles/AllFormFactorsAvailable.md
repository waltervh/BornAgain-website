### All available form factors

Scattering from all individual particle's shapes implemented in BornAgain.

* For each figure, one particular shape is used.

The dimensions of the object are chosen only in order to get a characteristic signature of the form factor in the same range of values for the output angles.

* The simulation is run using the Born approximation. There is no substrate and also no interference between the scattered waves.
* The wavelength is equal to 1Å.
* The incident angles are equal to αi = 0.2° and Φi = 0°.
