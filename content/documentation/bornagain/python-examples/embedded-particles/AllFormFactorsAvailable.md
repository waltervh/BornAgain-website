### All available form factors

Scattering from all individual particle's shapes implemented in BornAgain.

* For each figure, one particular shape is used.

The dimensions of the object are chosen only in order to get a characteristic signature of the form factor in the same range of values for the output angles.

* The simulation is run using the Born approximation. There is no substrate and also no interference between the scattered waves.
* The wavelength is equal to $1$ $\unicode{x212B}$.
* The incident angles are equal to $\alpha\_i = 0.2 ^{\circ}$ and $\phi\_i = 0^{\circ}$.
